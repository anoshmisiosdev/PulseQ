"""Automation rule engine: evaluates each business's enabled AutomationRules
against currently-scored customers and queues or sends outreach.

Runs on a schedule (Celery beat, see app/workers/celery_app.py) and can also be
triggered manually via POST /api/automations/dispatch. Every actual send goes
through app/services/compliance.py first — this is the one place TCPA/opt-out
rules are enforced, so there's exactly one path that can go wrong, not N.

"""Recovery attribution: did the outreach we sent actually bring anyone back?

This is the half of the product loop that was missing — ``RecoveryAttribution``
existed as a table that nothing ever wrote, so "3 customers recovered, ~$640
saved" was a number the frontend invented and forgot on refresh.

Two layers, same split as ``scoring/`` and ``services/activity.py``:

* :func:`match_recoveries` is **pure** — plain dataclasses in, matches out, no
  DB, no clock. All the judgement calls live here so they're unit-testable.
* :func:`detect_recoveries` does the I/O: load a tenant's sends and returns,
  run the matcher, write ``RecoveryAttribution`` rows.

The attribution rule is deliberately conservative and stated in one sentence,
because an owner will eventually ask us to defend it:

    **A customer counts as recovered if they visited or purchased after we
    contacted them, within their vertical's attribution window. Credit goes to
    the most recent message sent before that return (last touch), and the
    revenue recovered is what they actually spent inside that window — never an
    annualized projection.**

Consequences worth knowing:

* One recovery per customer. ``Customer.recovered`` is a boolean and a customer
  who lapses again later is a new story, not a second win on the same send.
* We under-claim rather than over-claim. A customer who was always going to come
  back gets credited to us (there is no control group yet — see the experiment
  engine discussion in the spec review), but we never credit revenue we didn't
  observe, and never credit a return that predates the send.

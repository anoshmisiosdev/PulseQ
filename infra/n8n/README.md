# n8n — customer/ops workflows for Pulse

Self-hosted via the `n8n` service in the root `docker-compose.yml` (no
n8n.cloud account, no third-party signup). Pulse only ever *notifies* n8n of
events it already decided to send — n8n never decides who's contactable.
See `app/services/n8n.py` for the guarantee: `do_not_contact` customers are
never forwarded.

## First run

```bash
docker compose up -d n8n
open http://localhost:5678
```

The first visit asks you to set an **owner account** for your local n8n
instance (email + password) — that's a one-time local setup screen, not a
third-party account. You need to complete that step yourself in the browser;
nothing here can (or should) fill in a password for you.

Once logged in: **Workflows → Import from File**, one at a time, for each
file below. Each webhook node's **Production URL** (looks like
`http://localhost:5678/webhook/<path>`) goes into `.env` as the matching
setting, then activate the workflow.

## The four that are wired and built

| File | `.env` setting | Fires from |
|---|---|---|
| `recovery-review-request.json` | `N8N_RECOVERY_WEBHOOK_URL` | `attribution.detect_recoveries()` — one `RecoveryAttribution` at a time |
| `approval-slack.json` | `N8N_APPROVAL_WEBHOOK_URL` | `automations.dispatch_automations()` — batched per rule per run |
| `band-change-compound-trigger.json` | `N8N_BAND_CHANGE_WEBHOOK_URL` | `ingest.refresh_scores()` — batched per tenant per re-score |
| `sync-failure-alert.json` | `N8N_SYNC_FAILURE_WEBHOOK_URL` | `ingest.record_sync_error()` |

All four go through `app/services/n8n.py` (best-effort, never blocks the
caller) and skip anyone with `do_not_contact` set where the payload is
customer-specific.

Each imported workflow ends in a "Post to Slack" or "Send email" node with a
comment saying **configure credentials** — open it and point it at your own
Slack app / SMTP account. Two things intentionally *not* built:

- **Slack reply → approve.** `approval-slack.json` posts "reply APPROVE
  `<send_id>`" but nothing listens for that reply yet — closing that loop
  needs a Slack app with an Events subscription calling back into
  `POST /api/automations/sends/{id}/approve`, which is real, separate scope
  (a public HTTPS endpoint + Slack app setup), not a template tweak.
- **The compound-trigger logic itself.** `band-change-compound-trigger.json`
  ships a single `band == high` IF node as a starting point — the actual
  point of this workflow is that *you* build the multi-condition logic Pulse's
  one-band-one-channel `AutomationRule` can't express, in n8n's UI.

## For production

Add whichever `N8N_*_WEBHOOK_URL` you're using to
`infra/aws/push-env-to-ssm.sh`'s `SECRET_KEYS` (done for
`N8N_RECOVERY_WEBHOOK_URL` already; add the other three the same way when
they go live), push, then add it to the ECS task definition's `secrets` block
(same pattern as `GOOGLE_MAPS_SERVER_API_KEY`) — and self-host n8n somewhere
reachable from there (an ECS task of its own, or n8n.cloud). Not done yet —
do it when a given flow is actually going live, not before.

## What's scoped but not built

| Use case | Why it's not just another webhook |
|---|---|
| Long-tail integrations (Mindbody, etc.) | Needs n8n *pushing into* Pulse (new inbound endpoint shaped like `integrations/base.py::DataSourceAdapter`), not Pulse pushing out — and there's no concrete third-party source picked yet. Speculative until one is. |
| Two-way customer replies | Needs a new inbound Twilio/Resend webhook, and has to interact with `compliance.py`'s STOP-word handling without weakening it — a dedicated pass, not a batch add-on. |
| Booking handoff | Same shape as the above two — no chosen booking provider yet. |

Building those now would be scaffolding for demand that doesn't exist yet.
